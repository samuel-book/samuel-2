# Outline - what is in this section?

This section demonstrates generation of synthetic data. Synthetic data may be useful to share when it is not possible to share original data. As we cannot demonstrate methods with original SAMueL data, here we use original Titanic passenger data to create new synthetic passenger data. We then train a logistic model on that synthetic data and test on real data that was not used to create the synthetic data.


* *Creating synthetic Titanic passenger data with SMOTE* Use of SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversamplying Technique) to generate synthetic data.
