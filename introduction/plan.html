<p>NIHR134326: Stroke Audit Machine Learning (SAMueL-2)</p>
<p>Note: This is a follow-on project to a NIHR HS&amp;DR project (Ref: 17/99/89), referred to here as SAMueL-1. An online book for SAMueL-1 (which includes both summaries and details of work) is available at: <a class="reference external" href="https://samuel-book.github.io/samuel-1">https://samuel-book.github.io/samuel-1</a></p>
<p>(This is Research Plan V3, 20/12/2021)</p>
<div class="section" id="summary-of-research">
<h2>Summary of research<a class="headerlink" href="#summary-of-research" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>BACKGROUND AND OVERALL AIM</p>
<p>In England and Wales, 11%-12% of emergency stroke patients receive thrombolysis, significantly below the NHS Long Term Plan target of 20% by 2025.</p>
<p>The overall aim of SAMUeL-2 is to work with the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) to increase the impact of national audit by providing advanced tools for in-depth comparisons between hospitals, helping to address the gap between actual and achievable thrombolysis use.</p>
<p>In previous work (SAMueL-1) we have used clinical pathway simulation and machine learning to model stroke pathways to thrombolysis at all (anonymised) hospitals, and to compare decision-making between hospitals. We found that about half of the current inter-hospital variation in thrombolysis use comes from differences in local patient populations and the other half from differences in hospital processes and decision-making. We found that stroke thrombolysis use could be reasonably expected to reach 18%-19% of hospitalised stroke patients. The largest single improvement would come from clinical decision-making at all hospitals being similar to 30 top- ‘benchmark’ hospitals with higher thrombolysis use. The next largest improvement would come from increasing the proportion of stroke patients whose stroke onset time is determined, to a level currently achieved by hospitals achieving upper quartile performance. Finally, speeding the stroke pathway at all hospitals would increase thrombolysis use, but by the smallest margin - although speeding the stroke pathway increases the clinical benefit of thrombolysis for all treated patients.</p>
<p>SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>Specific objectives are based on feedback received during SAMueL-1, and feedback on the SAMueL-2 bid proposal.</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Expansion of SAMueL-1 modelling to include: 1) outcome and adverse event prediction at patient-level, 2) inclusion of pre-hospital times in pathway model, 3) use of organisational factors (such as staffing) in predicting use of thrombolysis, and 4) piloting of a model that incorporates use of thrombectomy alongside thrombolysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Incorporation of health economic outcomes (Quality Adjusted Life Years): These will be adapted from other NIHR projects involving this team that have already developed health economic models for thrombolysis in acute ischaemic stroke.</p></li>
<li><p>Promote acceptance of the modelling by increased transparency and explainability: 1) make use of Shapley values to show the contribution of individual features to the prediction that the model is making, 2) improved methods for clustering of patients to clarify patterns of differences in clinical decision-making between hospitals and to allow identification of ‘similar hospitals’ (by patient population) for comparison, 3) investigation of bias in model (e.g. accuracy analysis by patient subgroups), 4) generation of dashboards and other interrogative methods.</p></li>
<li><p>Generation of synthetic data and artificial patient vignettes: 1) build on pilot work already performed for generating synthetic patient-level stroke data that may be shared freely and used for discussion of ’virtual’ patients, 2) automatic generation of artificial clinical vignettes from real or synthetic SSNAP data.</p></li>
<li><p>Co-production of project outputs with clinicians to promote acceptance and use for local quality improvement: By using both information gathering (through interviews) and intervention refinement (in workshops) we will incrementally modify and improve the content and style of our intervention (SAMueL tool). Working with our Public and Patient Involvement (PPI) group we will also produce key public-facing output.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="stroke">
<h3>Stroke<a class="headerlink" href="#stroke" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Stroke happens when blood flow to an area of the brain has been interrupted, causing cell death [1]. Stroke may be ischaemic, due to an arterial blockage, or haemorrhagic, due to bleeding. Stroke is the main cause of adult-onset long-term disability and a major burden on health and social care services. It was estimated that in 2010, there were 5.9 million deaths and 33 million stroke survivors worldwide [2]. Eighty-five thousand people are hospitalised with stroke each year in England, Wales and Northern Ireland [3]. Over the last 25 years in England stroke has consistently been one of the leading cause of lost disability-adjusted life years, which combine mortality and disability burdens [4].</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="intravenous-thrombolysis">
<h3>Intravenous thrombolysis<a class="headerlink" href="#intravenous-thrombolysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Intravenous thrombolysis is a ‘clot-busting’ therapy developed to treat ischaemic stroke by removing or reducing the blood clot obstructing blood flow in the brain. For ischaemic stroke, thrombolysis is an effective but time-critical treatment for the management of acute stroke if given within four and a half hours of stroke onset [5], and is recommended for use in expert guidelines worldwide [6].</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="targets-for-thrombolysis-use-and-speed">
<h3>Targets for thrombolysis use and speed<a class="headerlink" href="#targets-for-thrombolysis-use-and-speed" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The European Stroke Organisation have promoted a European Stroke Action Plan [7], including a target of at least 15% thrombolysis, with median onset-to-treatment times of &lt;120 minutes, noting that evidence suggests that achieving these targets may be aided by centralisation of stroke services [8,9]. An analysis of the largest randomised trial of thrombolysis concluded that 60% of ischaemic stroke patients arriving within 4 hours of known stroke onset were suitable for thrombolysis [10]. In 2016-18 in England and Wales, about 40% of emergency stroke patients arrived within 4 hours of known stroke onset (data from SAMueL-1). Given that about 85% is stroke is ischaemic, this gives a potential target of 20% thrombolysis.</p>
<p>The 2019 NHS Long Term Plan [11] sets out the ambition of 20% of emergency stroke patients receiving thrombolysis, such that by 2025 England will have amongst the best performance in Europe for delivering thrombolysis. This target is incorporated into the 2021 service specification for the 20 new Integrated Stroke Delivery Networks [12]. Current thrombolysis use in England and Wales is 11-12% on average but ranges from about 2% to 25% between hospitals [3], and has been static at this level for the last 8 years.</p>
<p>The NHS plan for improving stroke care also sets a target that patients should receive thrombolysis within 60 minutes of arrival, but ideally within 20 minutes [12]. Whilst this speed of thrombolysis, called door-to-needle time, provides an ambitious target, it has been shown to be achievable as Helsinki University Central Hospital has reported a median door-to-needle time of 20 minutes, with 94% of patients treated within 60 minutes [13] - a model that has proved rapidly transferable elsewhere [14]. This speed was achieved by innovative solutions like paramedics taking patients straight to the scanner and with thrombolysis delivered close to or in the scanner.</p>

<div class="section" id="clinical-audit">
<h3>Clinical audit<a class="headerlink" href="#clinical-audit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Clinical audit seeks to drive quality improvement through the measurement of clinical quality against evidence-based standards [15]. In England and Wales, the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP) is responsible for commissioning 28 national clinical audits which form the National Clinical Audit and Patient Outcomes Programme. The national audit of stroke is the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP), which collects data on the processes and outcomes of stroke care up to 6 months post-stroke for more than 90% of acute stroke admissions to hospitals in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Every year data from approximately 85,000 patients are collected. SSNAP publishes quarterly and yearly analysis of results on its website [16].</p>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h4>Clinical audit<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Foy et al. [17] recently revisited the case for national audits being effective and how they may be improved. Audit and feedback have been found to improve care, for example by showing individuals or providers that they are outliers, but it is important that recipients of the feedback are convinced by the audit, see it as specific to them and that audit promotes improvement action beyond simply measurement. A barrier to accepting feedback is the belief (true or otherwise) that “my patients are different”. Also, persistent negative feedback can lead to disconnection from the process of quality improvement. Foy calls for more intelligent use of audit with the call.</p>
<p><em>“Audit and feedback are widely used, sometimes abused, and often under-realised in healthcare. More imaginative design and responses are overdue; these require evidence-informed conversations between clinicians, patients, and academic communities. It is time to fully leverage national audits to accelerate data guided improvement and reduce unwarranted variations in healthcare. The status quo is no longer ethical.”</em> Foy et al. 2020.</p>
<p>We respond to this challenge by using state-of-the-art modelling and machine learning tools that:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Are co-produced with clinicians to maximise perceived usefulness and minimise perceived threat.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow for differences in hospital patient populations (no ‘one target fits all’ approach).</p></li>
<li><p>Are patient-centred – focussing on outcomes as well as thrombolysis use. We will also identify types of patients where decision-making differs between hospitals, exemplified by artificial patient vignettes.</p></li>
<li><p>Are comprehendible by clinicians to build acceptance/validity.</p></li>
<li><p>Are action-focussed – identifying the actions to prioritise that will make most difference.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We are encouraged by discussions we have had on outputs from our previous work with several of the new Integrated Stroke Delivery Networks (ISDNs). Our existing work has stimulated significant interest already, particularly in the bespoke nature of the analysis and feedback. This encourages us regarding positive engagement with these improvement networks, especially regarding support with involving sites and/or clinicians that might otherwise be reluctant to engage or are sceptical about nationally-dictated ‘top down’ or ‘one size fits all’ targets.</p>

<h2>Summary of findings from SAMueL-1<a class="headerlink" href="#summary-of-findings-from-samuel-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We built clinical pathway simulation models, and clinical decision-making models, based on patient-level data from SSNAP. We built machine learning models that would closely replicate the clinical decisions made at each hospital, predicting if a patient who arrived within the treatment window would receive thrombolysis. The decision models are based on clinical pathway timings and patient clinical features recorded in SSNAP, such as age, components of the stroke severity scale (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; NIHSS), co-morbidities such as atrial fibrillation etc. The clinical decision-making models allow us to ask the counter-factual question, “What treatment would my patient be likely to receive at other hospitals?”. The clinical pathway simulation models predicted each hospital’s thrombolysis rate with an average absolute error of less than 0.5 percentage points. The clinical decision-making models predicted clinical decisions with 85% accuracy (achieving 84% sensitivity and specificity simultaneously) for those patients arriving within 4 hours of known stroke onset, with neural networks or random forest models having the highest accuracy.</p>
<p>Using our models, we found that about half of the current inter-hospital variation in thrombolysis is accounted for by differences in local patient populations. Most of the remaining inter-hospital differences were attributable to differences in clinical decision-making and, to a lesser extent, difference in hospital processes such as door-to-needle time.</p>
<p>We then tested three alternative scenarios at each hospital: 1) What if door-to-needle time was 30 minutes?, 2) What if all hospitals determined stroke onset time at least as frequently as the current upper quartile of hospitals?, 3) What if clinical decisions were made according to the majority vote of 30 top ‘benchmark’ hospitals? These benchmark hospitals are the 30 acutely-admitting stroke units with highest predicted users of thrombolysis using a standard set of 10,000 patients passed through all hospital decision models. The infographic below summarises our modelling findings. We found that making these changes at all hospitals would increase the national average thrombolysis rate to 18-19% (range 6-27%). The change that would have most impact would be alignment of clinical decision-making with hospitals more enthusiastic in their use of thrombolysis, then through better ascertainment of stroke onset times, and finally through speeding internal processes - although reducing door-to-needle time has a larger effect on overall clinical benefit, as they will benefit all patients who receive thrombolysis. For every additional 10 patients treated under these scenarios the primary reason was: clinical decision making in 5, determining stroke onset time in 4, and door-to-needle time in 1. The modelling produces a bespoke breakdown for each hospital, giving the realistic and achievable thrombolysis rate, and the impact of each component - helping to identify at each hospital which change would make the greatest difference to outcomes for their own local population. This is an important finding as prior to this, most improvement effort in thrombolysis has been based on the generalised assumption that the largest improvements in thrombolysis rate come from reductions in door-to-needle time [13].</p>
